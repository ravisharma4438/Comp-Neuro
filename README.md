# Comp-Neuro

This project models human decision-making behavior in which a person is trying to choose between two items (such as two menu items at a restaurant) . The attached pictures show the decision surfaces for deciding immediately, delaying a decision, and a 2d reduction of the problem.

## Getting Started

The project runs in MATLAB and Octave. In the command window, enter the following command to run: plotvaluefn_valuebased(16, 4, 0, 5)

### Prerequisites

Simply, standard MATLAB or Octave is required.
